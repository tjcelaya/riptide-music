~~~Basic SQL Queries~~~

!!!Remember to "quote" your strings!!!


~ADDING A REVIEW FOR AN ALBUM~

The review is inserted into the Reviews table, which has schema:
memName - albumID - review

Because this schema calls for albumID, rather than albumName,
you can use this nested SQL query to find the albumID using the
albumName.

You will need:
1. The name of the member submitting the review.
2. The name of the album they are reviewing.
3. The review represented as a string.

  INSERT INTO Reviews
  VALUES ("<memName>", (SELECT albumID
                      FROM Albums 
                      WHERE albumName = "<albumName>"),
          "<Review text>");

~ADDING A RATING FOR AN ALBUM

The rating is inserted into the Rates table, which has schema:
memName - albumID - rating

This query is implemented just like the other one, only the
integer rating will replace the text review.

You will need:
1. The name of the member submitting the rating.
2. The name of the album they are rating.
3. The rating represented as an integer.

  INSERT INTO Rates
  VALUES ("<memName>", (SELECT albumID
                      FROM Albums
                      WHERE albumName = "<albumName>"),
          <rating>);
